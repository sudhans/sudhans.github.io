        This is an open source Android app. The source code is available on
        GitHub under GNU GPL3 license.

        <p>
          I, Madhusudhan Sarvodhaya, as a developer, consider privacy and
          security seriously. This app as such does not collect any user data or
          publish data to third party sites. No advertisement or analytics
          related libraries are included in this app.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently
          caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your
          privacy, you may post a dicussion on github or send an email, and I
          will try to help.
        </p>

        <p>
          For security purpose, please consider installing apps only from Google
          Play Store. This applies to any app you may use on your android
          device.

        <p>
          The app only requires Storage permission to save screenshot. This
          permission is required only for devices running Android 9 or below.
          You may decide to deny the permission if you are not going to use the
          "Screenshot" feature.
